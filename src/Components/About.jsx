                                    We started as a two-person team, crafting each item by hand. We were passionate about creating high-quality products,
                                    and we were willing to put in the hard work to make it happen. Over time, our business grew, and we were able to hire more
                                    people to help us. Today, we have a team of over 100 people, and we are still committed to creating the best possible products.
